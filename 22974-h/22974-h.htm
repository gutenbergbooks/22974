<h1><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p><span class='u'>The City Bride</span>, by Joseph Harris, is of special interest as the only
adaptation from the canon of John Webster to have come upon the stage in the
Restoration. Nahum Tate&rsquo;s <span class='u'>Injur&rsquo;d Love: or, The Cruel Husband</span> is an adaptation
of <span class='u'>The White Devil</span>, but it was never acted and was not printed until
1707. <span class='u'>The City Bride</span> is taken from <span class='u'>A Cure for a Cuckold</span>, in which William
Rowley and perhaps Thomas Heywood collaborated with Webster. F. L. Lucas,
Webster&rsquo;s most recent and most scholarly editor, remarks that <span class='u'>A Cure for a
Cuckold</span> is one of the better specimens of Post-Elizabethan romantic comedy.
In particular, the character of the bride, Annabel (Arabella in Harris&rsquo;s
adaptation), has a universal appeal. <span class='u'>The City Bride</span>, a very close copy of
its original, retains its virtues, and has some additional virtues of its own.</p>

<p>Not much is known of its author, Joseph Harris. Genest first notices
him as playing Bourcher, the companion of a French pirate, in <span class='u'>A Common-Wealth
of Women</span>. Thomas Durfey&rsquo;s alteration of <span class='u'>The Sea Voyage</span> from the Beaumont and
Fletcher folio, which was produced about September 1685. His subsequent
roles were of a similar calibre, but if he never rose to be a star he seems
to have become a valued supporting player, for in 1692 he was chosen to join
the royal &ldquo;comedians in ordinary.&rdquo; He did not at first side with Thomas
Betterton in his quarrel with the patentees of the theatre in 1694-5, but he
withdrew with him to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. Genest notices him for the last
time as playing Sir Richard Vernon in Betterton&rsquo;s adaptation of <span class='u'>1 Henry IV</span>,
which was produced about April 1700.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
During his career on the stage Harris found time to compose a tragi-comedy,
<span class='u'>The Mistakes, or, The False Report</span> (1691), produced in December 1690;
<span class='u'>The City Bride</span>, produced in 1696; and a comedy and a masque, <span class='u'>Love&rsquo;s a Lottery,
and a Woman the Prize. With a New Masque, call&rsquo;d Love and Riches Reconcil&rsquo;d</span>
(1699), produced about March 1698/9. <span class='u'>The Mistakes</span> is clearly apprentice work,
for Harris acknowledges in a preface the considerable help of William Mountfort,
who took the part of the villain, Ricardo. Mountfort, who had already written
three plays himself, cut one of the scenes intended for the fifth act and
inserted one of his own composition (probably the last) which not only clarified
the plot but also elevated the character of the part he was to play.
The company seems to have done its best by the budding dramatist, for Dryden
wrote the prologue, a rather unusual one in prose and verse, and Tate supplied
the epilogue. Harris professed himself satisfied with the play&rsquo;s reception,
but owned that it was Mountfort&rsquo;s acting which really carried it off.</p>

<p><span class='u'>The City Bride</span>, on the other hand, shows its author completely self-assured,
and rightly so. No doubt some of his ease comes from the fact that
he had nothing to invent, but in large part it must derive from his ten-years&rsquo;
experience on the stage. Harris added nothing to the plot of <span class='u'>The City Bride</span>,
although he commendably shifted its emphasis, as his title makes clear, from
infidelity to fidelity; but he rewrote the dialogue almost completely, and
the new dialogue is remarkable good. The reader will notice that it is,
except for the last half of the first act, printed as prose. The quarto of
<span class='u'>A Cure for a Cuckold</span>, from which Harris worked, is also largely printed as
prose, but has correct verse lineation in the same portion of the first act.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
It is the more remarkable that Harris, following thus closely the apparent
form of his original, could vary from it so successfully. Most notable,
probably, are the passages in which he intensified the expression of his
source. They may indicate no more than the eternal &ldquo;ham&rdquo; in our author;
but I think they probably indicate as well a new style of acting, more
rhetorical in one way, more natural in another. A good example, in which
the new rhetoric is not oppressive, is the account of the sea fight at the
end of Act III. Even when Harris followed his original most closely, we
seem to hear the actor, speaking in a new tongue, in a more relaxed and
colloquial rhythm. The reader will find it both amusing and instructive to
compare the two versions of Act II, scene ii. The new cadences do more than
merely prove that Harris had no ear for blank verse.</p>

<p><span class='u'>The City Bride</span> does not conform to the dominant type of Restoration
comedy, but it belongs to a thriving tradition. Domestic comedy, in adaptations
from the Elizabethans, had been staged at intervals for twenty years
before <span class='u'>The City Bride</span> appeared, and the type was of course destined to
supplant gay comedy in the near future. Harris was not, therefore, going
against the taste of the town; on the contrary he was regularly guided by
contemporary taste and practice. His stage is less crowded: he amalgamated
the four gallants of <span class='u'>A Cure for a Cuckold</span> in the person of Mr. Spruce, at
the expense of a dramatic scene (I, ii, 31-125); and he ended the sub-plot
with the fourth act instead of bringing its persons into the final scene,
with some loss of liveliness and a concomitant gain in unity of effect. He
modernized his dialogue entirely, bringing up to date the usage and allusions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of his original, and restraining the richness of its metaphor by removing
the figures altogether or by substituting others more familiar. He omitted
a good deal of bawdry, especially in Act II, scene ii. All these changes
have parallels in other Restoration adaptations. Again, the songs and dances,
which are all of Harris&rsquo;s composition, reflect the demand of the Restoration
audience for excitement, variety, novelty, in their dramatic fare. When in
Act III, scene i, Harris meets this demand by making Bonvile bare his breast
to Friendly&rsquo;s sword, and Friendly a little later grovel at Bonvile&rsquo;s feet
for pardon, we may condemn the new business as bathetic; but when in Act IV,
scene i, he substitutes for Webster&rsquo;s emaciated jokes the bustle of drawers,
the sound of the bar bell, and healths all around, we can only applaud the
change.</p>

<p>We must also commend Harris for supplying a consistent and relatively
believable motivation for the main action. In both <span class='u'>A Cure for a Cuckold</span> and
<span class='u'>The City Bride</span>, Clare (Clara) begins the action by giving her suitor,
Lessingham (Friendly), a cryptic message: he is to determine who his best
friend is and kill him. In <span class='u'>A Cure for a Cuckold</span>, it is never made clear
whether the victim should have been Bonvile or Clare herself (she apparently
intended to trick Lessingham into poisoning her). This uncertainty has only
recently been noticed by students of the drama, who have been forced to
emend the text at IV, ii, 165 (see Lucas&rsquo;s note on the passage). Harris&rsquo;s
solution is simpler. He will have nothing to do with either murder or
suicide. Clara explains to Friendly that the best friend of a lover is love
itself.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>
<p>This is not the place to enumerate all the differences between
<span class='u'>A Cure for a Cuckold</span> and <span class='u'>The City Bride</span>; indeed the reader may prefer making
the comparisons for himself. Harris&rsquo;s alterations follow the general pattern
of Restoration adaptations from the earlier drama, it is true. On the other
hand, a relatively small number of such plays allow us to see the professional
actor feeling his way through the emotions and actions of the scenes. To
compare a play like <span class='u'>The City Bride</span> with its source is like visiting the
rehearsals of an acting company of the time. Such a play has an immediacy
and liveness that strongly appeals to those who delight to image forth the
past.</p>

<p><span class='u'>The City Bride</span> has never been reprinted. The present edition reproduces,
with permission, the copy in the Henry E. Huntington Library, omitting Harris&rsquo;s
signed dedication to Sir John Walter, Bart., on A2<sup>r</sup>-A3<sup>r</sup> (A1<sup>v</sup> in the original is
blank). The top line on page 44, which is partly cut away, reads: <span class='u'>Cla.</span> Who

The reason I suppose is this, because they have Crowds of Thoughts, that still perplex

<p><i>Mer.</i> Yes, I have one thank Heaven! You wou&rsquo;d be glad Sister you cou&rsquo;d say so,

<p><i>Sum.</i> I&rsquo;ll direct you, Madam; Well overtaken.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Bless me, Sir; What are you?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> A Man.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> An honest Man, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Yes faith in some Respects, I&rsquo;m very honest, but not altogether so; I were
not fit to live in the World if I were too honest, Child.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Alas! then I begin to fear: Pray tell me what you are?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Why, faith, an honest Thief.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> How, honest, and yet a Thief? I never heard they were of Kin before;
Pray, Heaven, I find it now.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Indeed! a very honest Thief.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Well, Sir, since that&rsquo;s your Title, pray use me kindly: Nay, I&rsquo;m sure you will,
there&rsquo;s something in your Looks which speaks you mild and noble.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Yes, I am a Gentleman, and you shall find me so; for I&rsquo;ll not offer you the
least shew of Violence, or offer to corrupt your Chastity; th&ocirc; indeed you are tempting
Fair, and might inflame a colder Heart than mine: Yet Ravishing&rsquo;s no part of my
Profession as yet; or if it were, you look so charming Innocent, you wou&rsquo;d disarm
my wildest Thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Blessings on your Goodness!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<i>Sum.</i> Are you a Maid, or Wife?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I am both, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Then this it seems is your Wedding-day, and these the Hours of Interim that
keep you in that double State?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Indeed you are in the right.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Come then, I&rsquo;ll be brief, and hinder not your desired <i>Hymen</i>. You have some
superfluous Toys I see about you, which you must deliver; I mean, that Chain of
Gold and Pearl about your Neck, and those pretty Bracelets about your Arms, (pray,
Heaven, they prove not Emblems of the combined Hemp which is to halter mine);
come, Madam, pray deliver &rsquo;em.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Nay, I intreat you, Sir, to take &rsquo;em, for I cannot give &rsquo;em, they are lock&rsquo;d
you see, and truly I have not the Key about me; it may be you are furnish&rsquo;d with Instruments
that may unloose &rsquo;em, I pray do.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> No faith, Madam, I&rsquo;m but a Beginner in this same Business, and am wholly
unprovided of any Pick-lock Tools besides this Sword.<br />

<p><i>Ara.</i> O, good Sir, do not shew me that, &rsquo;tis too frightful; pray hurt me not, for
I do yield them freely: Use your Hands, perhaps their strength will serve to tear
&rsquo;em from me without more ado. Some Pain I&rsquo;ll quietly endure, provide you do not
hurt me much.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Alas, dear Lady, I&rsquo;ll use you as gently as I can
upon my Word; but &rsquo;tis devilish strong.&mdash;If I hurt you, pray speak.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[He endeavours to break the Chain about her Neck.]</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Not much, Sir.</p>

<span class='i ralign'>[She draws his Sword, and stands upon her Guard.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> No Sir, nor shall not now: You a Highway-man and guard your self no better:
Come, Sir, what Money have you? Deliver quickly.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Not a Cross by this foolish Hand of mine!</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> How, no Money, &rsquo;twere pity then to take this from thee;
Here, take it again, I know you&rsquo;l use me ne&rsquo;re the worse for what
I have done.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[Gives him his Sword again.]</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> No, by my Life!</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I do believe you; and now pray hear me&mdash;Here on my Knees, in sight of
Heaven, I make this solemn Protestation, That if you&rsquo;l but forbear the Rifling of this
Chain and Bracelets, and go but with me Home, by all the Vows which I this Day
have plighted to my dearest Husband, I will deliver you in Money the full Value of
these I wear, and cannot for my Life get off.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Ha! Ready-money is the Prize I look for; it passes without suspicion every
where, when Chains and Jewels are often stop&rsquo;d and call&rsquo;d for before the Magistrate:
But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Nay never doubt! You saw I gave you my Advantage up, and questioned not
my safety at your hands, pray fear not yours in mine.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> I know not what to do.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Pray tell me, Sir, did you ever think a Woman true?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> I have heard of some, but very few.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Will you add one more to your belief?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<i>Sum.</i> I think I may, for they were fewer than the Articles of my Faith, therefore
I have room for you, and will believe you&mdash;Yet stay, you say you&rsquo;l ransom your
jewels with Ready-money when you come Home; so you may, and then discover
me.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Shall I repeat the Vows I made?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> No, for I&rsquo;ll trust you; and if you do betray me, then Mercy upon me, and
Farewel. I knew a Gentleman that had been a Courtier at <i>Whitehall</i> fifteen Years,
and he was buried e&rsquo;re he took a Bride: &rsquo;Tis very strange you&rsquo;l say; and may be my
Case in another way.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Come, Sir, never fear: A Man and afraid; Fie, fie!</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Give me your Hand, I&rsquo;ll wait on you; and if you are (as I believe you) True
and Just, you are the World&rsquo;s Wonder! Come, Madam.<br />

<p class='sd'>Enter two Boys, one with a Child in his Arms. <span class='n'>Compass</span> on the other side.</p>

<p><i>1 Boy.</i> <i>Jack</i>, Who&rsquo;s this?</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> O <i>Jeminy</i>! I&rsquo;ll be hang&rsquo;d if it ben&rsquo;t Goodman <i>Compass</i>, that they said was
dead three Years ago.</p>

<p><i>1 Boy.</i> Od&rsquo;s Life, and so it is!</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> O <i>London</i>! sweet <i>London</i>! Do I live to see thee once again? My Eyes are
full of Brine for Joy. And if my dear <i>Peggy</i> be but living still, I shall cry &rsquo;em out.</p>

<p><i>1 Boy.</i> Goodman <i>Compass</i>, I am glad to see you; You are welcome home.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Thank you, good Lad: Honest <i>Jack</i> here too? Why, thou art grown a
little Man since I saw thee last: What, is that thy own, heh?</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> I am fain to keep it, you see, whoever got it; it may be other Mens Cases
as well as mine.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Thou say&rsquo;st true <i>Jack</i>: But whose pretty Knave is it?</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> My Dame&rsquo;s where I live.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> And not thy Master&rsquo;s?</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> Nay, nay, I can&rsquo;t tell that neither: My Master loves it as well as if it were
his own, and for ought I see better than my Dame.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> A very good Lad by my Troth!</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> But, Goodman <i>Compass</i>, I can tell you News, Your Wife has a brave Boy too
of her own, not above a Quarter old, as big as two of this.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Ha! say&rsquo;st thou so, <i>Jack</i>? Ha, ha, ha, by my Troth I am heartily glad to
hear it: I&rsquo;ll give thee a dozen of Ale, and thy News be true, Boy.</p>

<p><i>1 Boy.</i> I assure you &rsquo;tis very true: All your Neighbours can tell you the same.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Ha, ha, ha! But a Quarter old, and so lusty, say you? What plaguy thundering
Boys are got now-a-days: I Gad, I shall split my Sides with Laughing; Ha,
ha, ha.&mdash;But <i>Jack</i>, I have been loth to ask thee all this while, for fear of ill News,
how does my Wife?</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> O never better, nor ever so lusty and handsome&mdash;And truly she wears better
Clothes than she was wont, especially on Holy-days: she has Silk-Gowns, and Lac&rsquo;d-Petticoats,
and fine <i>Holland</i>-Smocks too, they say, that have seen &rsquo;em: And some of
our Neighbours say, they were taken up in <i>Cheap</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<i>Comp.</i> Like enough, <i>Jack</i>; and there they must be paid for&mdash;Well, good Lads,
go and tell my Wife the joyful Tidings of my Return.</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> That I will with all my Heart, for she heard you were dead long ago.</p>

<p><i>1 Boy.</i> Nay, I&rsquo;ll go along with you <i>Jack</i>.</p>

<p><i>2 Boy.</i> Come then.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Exeunt 2 Boys.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Well, <i>Peggy</i>, if I am one of the Livery, I thank thee for it: The Cuckolds
are the greatest Company in all the City: And we have more Aldermen among us,
than all the other put them together.</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Peg, Compass</span>&rsquo;s Wife.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> O my dear sweet Honey-suckle! Art thou alive? I am glad to see
thee with all my Heart and Soul, so I am.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[Runs and kisses him.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> O, ho! good Spouse, give me leave to shed a few pearly Tears; the Fountain
of Love will have its Course: And th&ocirc; I cannot Sing at first sight, yet I can Cry
you see. I am as it were new come into the World; and Children Cry before they
Laugh, a long time you know.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Yes; and so thou art new born indeed to me, my <i>Numpy</i>; for I was told you
were dead long since, and never thought to see this dear sweet Face of thine again:
I heard thou wert div&rsquo;d to the bottom of the Sea, and that you never did intend to see
poor <i>Peggy</i> more.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> He, he, he, I was going down, as you say <i>Peg</i>, but I thought better on&rsquo;t, and
turn&rsquo;d back: I heard an ill Report of my Neighbours there; the devouring Sharks,
and other Sea-Monsters, whose Company, to tell you the Truth, I did not like;
and therefore resolv&rsquo;d to come home and bide with thee my Girl&mdash;Come kiss thy
poor Hubby, kiss me I say, for Sorrow begins to ebb apace.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> A thousand, thousand Welcomes home dear <i>Numpy</i>!</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> An Ocean of Thanks, kind <i>Peggy</i>: Well, and how goes all at Home? What
Lank still, poor <i>Peg</i>? Wil&rsquo;t ne&rsquo;re be full Sea at our Wharf?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Alas, Husband, what do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> A Lass, is it, or a Lad, Wench? I shou&rsquo;d be glad of both; I look&rsquo;d for a
pair of Compasses long afore now.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> What, and you from home, Love?</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> I from home? Why th&ocirc; I was from home, and other of our Neighbours
from home, does that follow that every body else is from home?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> I am pleased you are so merry, Husband.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Merry, nay I&rsquo;ll be merrier yet; why shou&rsquo;d I be sorry? I hope my Boy&rsquo;s
well, is he not? Od&rsquo;s fish, I look for another by this Time.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Boy, what Boy, Deary?</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> What Boy! why the Boy I got when I came home in the Cock-boat one
Night, about a Year ago; You have not forgotten it, I hope, I think I left behind
me for a Boy, and a Boy I look for.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> I find he knows all&mdash;What shall I do? <span class='i ralign'>[Aside.]</span><br />
O dear Husband, pray pardon me. <span class='i ralign'>[Kneels.]</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Pardon thee; why I hope thou hast not made away with my Boy, hast
thou? Od&rsquo;s death I&rsquo;ll hang thee, if there were never a Whore more in <i>London</i>, if thou
hast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<i>Peg.</i> O no; but your long Absence, and the Rumour of your Death, [<i>Cries.</i>]
made me think I might venture.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Venture, quoth a, I can&rsquo;t blame thee, <i>Peg</i>; for <i>Wapping</i>, if it were twice
<i>Wapping</i>, can&rsquo;t hold out always, no more than <i>Redriff</i>, <i>Limehouse</i> or <i>Shadwel</i>, nay or
the strongest Suburbs about <i>London</i>; and when it comes to that, wo be to the City
too, Girl.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Consider, Husband, I&rsquo;m but a Woman, neither the first or last that have done
the same, and truly I won&rsquo;t deny but I have a Child.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Have you so? And what by Consequence must I have then, I pray?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> If you&rsquo;l forgive me this Time, it shall be so no more, indeed and indeed, now.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Well, well. I will forgive thee, <i>Peg</i>, upon this Condition, that you tell me
who it was that fell foul aboard thee, and sprung this Leak in thee.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> O dear Husband!</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Nay, no Excuses, for I must know.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Why then truly it was Mr. <i>Venter</i> the Merchant.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> I am beholding to him, and wou&rsquo;d requite his Civility, if his Wife were but
as willing, th&ocirc; he be one of our Merchants at Sea, he shall give me leave to be Owner
at home; and where is my Boy? what, shan&rsquo;t I see him?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Yes if you please, good Husband: He&rsquo;s nurs&rsquo;d at <i>Bednal green</i>; &rsquo;tis now too
late, to Morrow will be better.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Come then we&rsquo;l home and to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> Welcome to all of us.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> But where&rsquo;s the Bridegroom, Girl? Od&rsquo;s bobs we&rsquo;re all at a Nonplus here,
at a stand, quite out; the Musicks ceas&rsquo;d, and we all look as th&ocirc; there were neither a
light Heart or Heel among us; nay, my Cousin <i>Clara</i> too as cloudy as on a washing Day.</p>

<p><i>Clara.</i> &rsquo;Tis then because you will not dance with me, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> &rsquo;Tis I alone have cause to be sad, if this Day&rsquo;s Happiness cou&rsquo;d admit of any;
But I&rsquo;ve long reason&rsquo;d with my pressing Thoughts, and from them drawn some
Symptoms of Relief. Suppose this Day hath long since appointed by my dear

Bough that moves, puts us in fear of present Apprehension. Sure I shall never thrive
on this Trade: Perhaps I need take no further Care, I may be now near to my
Journey&rsquo;s End, or at least in a fair way to <i>Newgate</i>, and from thence to <i>Tyburn</i>, the
only Place that we poor Rogues can claim for an Inheritance. Trust a Woman, and
with a Matter of such Importance, what a simple Dog am I? I cou&rsquo;d find in my Heart
to run away: And that were base to run from a woman; I can lay claim to nothing
but her Vows, and those the Women seldom or never mind.</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Arabella</span>.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> So, Sir, now you shall find a Woman as good as her Promise;  Here are 20
Pieces, the full Value, on my Life, of what they cost.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Pray, Madam, do not thus suspend my doubtful Soul; but if you do design
to insnare my Life, speak, speak freely: Or if the Constable be at the Door, let him
shew his Staff of Authority, perhaps I may corrupt him with a Bribe.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> How! base ungrateful Man, do you suspect my Faith? Nay then, Father,
Uncle, and Gentlemen, where are you?</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter all as before.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> How now, how now! What&rsquo;s the matter, Girl?</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> For shame, will you not entertain your Kinsman here a little better: you
leave him here alone, as th&ocirc; you despised his Company.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Is that all? I thought the Bridegroom had been return&rsquo;d: Sir, pray pardon
this Rudeness; But indeed I had quite forgot you, quite forgot you, as I hope to be
sav&rsquo;d: But what makes you tremble, Sir, are you ill dispos&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Think you he hath not reason to be ill-disposed at this cold <span class='i ralign'>[Aside to Justice <span class='n'>Merryman</span>.]</span><br />
Entertainment? for my part I blush for shame.</p>

<p><i>Spr.</i> Come pray, Sir, shake off this Dulness, and participate of our
Mirth, Od&rsquo;s nigs do.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> I am very well, Sir, I thank you, only the Gentleman is a little under a Mistake.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> It may be so, Ay, ay, it may be so; I vow I thought you had trembled, but I
believe it might be my own Hand; you must pardon me, I was stiffer once.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Sir, your humble Servant.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> But, Gentlemen, what think you of an Adventure?</p>

<p><i>Spr.</i> Adventure whither?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<i>Mer.</i> Why, to the <i>East-Indies</i>? I have a Vessel, Gentlemen, called the <i>Sea-Horse</i>,
bound thither, and to morrow I do expect her to sail. Now, Gentlemen, if you&rsquo;l
venture, ye shall have fair Dealing, that I&rsquo;ll promise you. And for the French, you
need not fear them, for she is a smart new Vessel: Nay, she hath a Letter of Mart
too, and twenty brave roaring Boys on both Sides her, Starboard and Larboard:
And I intend to go as far as <i>Marget</i> down with her, &rsquo;twill be as good as Physick
to me.</p>

<p><i>Spr.</i> A very good Motion, Sir, I begin, there&rsquo;s my ten Pieces.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> And, Sir, if a proffer&rsquo;d Love may be accepted, be pleased to take my ten
Pieces with you.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Your&rsquo;s above all the rest, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> That&rsquo;s kindly said, Sir, and I thank you: Now pray venture Ten more for
my sake.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Alas, Madam, it&rsquo;s a younger Brother&rsquo;s Portion.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> At my Request, Sir, venture the other Ten; if you want, I&rsquo;ll supply you with
as many more.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> With all my Heart then: Come, Sir, if you please, I&rsquo;ll double mine: So now
she&rsquo;s got her Gold again, and I am now no Thief, (<i>aside</i>) Sir, I have a Suit to you,<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[To <span class='n'>Merryman</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> You may command it, for I am always at your Service: But pray your
Pleasure?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> My Request, Sir, is, to have the Honour of keeping you Company to Sea, for
I have a great desire to see <i>Marget</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Sir, I shall be very happy in your good Company.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> I hope you will be both better acquainted e&rsquo;re you return; and by that time
your Kinsman may be here to make you more welcome.</p>

<i>A Wood</i></h2>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Bonvile</span> and <span class='n'>Friendly</span>.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Come my brave <i>Friendly</i>, I think we are here the first: Your Enemy is not
yet i&rsquo;th Field; let&rsquo;s walk a Turn or two, perhaps by that time he may arrive.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> I&rsquo;m very confident that he&rsquo;s here already.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Thy Looks, me-thinks, speak Conquest sure thy own; an ardent Rage has
kindled both thy Cheeks.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Like a red Morning, Friend; which still foretels a stormy Day to follow&mdash;And
now I well observe your Face, me-thinks it waxes pale, there&rsquo;s Death in it already.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> How, <i>Friendly</i>, do you then take me for a Coward? My Face look pale, and
Death in it already? By Heav&rsquo;n, shou&rsquo;d any but my <i>Friendly</i> dare to tell me what
thou hast said, my Sword shou&rsquo;d ram the base Affront down the curst Villain&rsquo;s Throat.
But you are my Friend, and I must only chide your Error. But prethee tell me who
is it you are to fight with, for as yet I am ignorant both of the Cause and Person.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Ha, his Name! Did you enquire his Name?</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> I dare not yet reveal it for fear of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> For fear of what?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O Confusion! I know not what to say!</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> How, afraid to tell his Name? Then I begin to doubt the Justice of your
Quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Too well you may, for by yon&rsquo; setting Sun, that Globe of heavenly Light
I swear, I come to kill the only Man that strives to save my Life&mdash;Man did I say?
Nay more than common Man, for those the World abound with; but such a Man besides,
all this vast Land affords not.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> By this your large Encomium of your Friend, I&rsquo;m afraid &rsquo;twas Wine first
made your Quarrel, and thereupon this Challenge did ensue.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O no! I call the Powers above to witness, that in all the Course of our unhappy
Friendship, I to my knowledg never did receive the least Affront or Injury
from him.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> How came this Challenge then?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O dear Friend, the noblest that Man cou&rsquo;d ever boast of: [<i>embraces him</i>]
When first my rigid Fate threw on me this Command to fight, I had recourse to many
whom I always thought my Friends; but when the Touchstone of my Danger
try&rsquo;d &rsquo;em, I found &rsquo;em like the cursed Fruit of <i>Sodom</i>, fair without, but rotten at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the Heart: But then I found out <i>Bonvile</i>, my only dearest Friend. <i>Bonvile</i> no sooner
heard of my Engagement, but flew unto my Succour with as much Bravery, as a great
General hastned by Alarms, marches to meet the Foe: You left your Nuptial Bed
perhaps to meet your Death. O unheard-of Friendship! My Father gave me Life,
&rsquo;tis true; but you, my Friend, support my Honour. All this for me, while I, ungrateful
Man, thus seek your Life: For to my eternal Horror be it spoke, you are
the Man whom I come here to kill.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Too true alas! there read the Warrant for your Death.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Gives him the Letter.]</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> &rsquo;Tis a Woman&rsquo;s Hand.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Yes, and a bad One too, they all speak fair, write foul, but mean worse.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> How! kill me? Sure, I dream, and this is all Delusion, or else thou dost it
only to try thy Friend.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O, from my Soul, I wish it were no more. But read, read on, see how I&rsquo;m fetter&rsquo;d
in a <i>Circe&rsquo;s</i> Charms&mdash;I love beyond Imagination, love even to Madness, and
must as madly do a Deed will damn me to the hottest Flames of Hell.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> And woo&rsquo;t thou kill thy Friend for such a Woman?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Alas! I must, you see I am commanded, commanded too by Love; Love
more powerful than all the Sacred Ties of Friendship, therefore draw, and guard thy
self.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[Draws.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Not I by Heaven! What wou&rsquo;dst thou have me draw and kill my Friend?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> There thou stab&rsquo;st my Soul. O where, where is now my Resolution fled? A
fatal Blast has struck me; a sudden Horror shot me thr&ocirc; the Heart; a Trembling
seiz&rsquo;d my Knees, that I can hardly stand, and all my Vital Powers methinks seem
dead; yet Love&rsquo;s the Fire must kindle all again, therefore I charge thee draw, or
naked as thou art, I will assail thee.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I am defended against all that thou canst do, in having Justice on my Side, and
Friendship too to back it.</p>

<div class="i poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But since Humanity now bears so sway,<br /></span>

<p>Strike home be sure. <span class='i ralign'>[Opens his Bosom.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> That were a barbarous Murder.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> How can the Effect prove different from the Cause? Or how can any thing
but damn&rsquo;d Barbarity ensue a Woman&rsquo;s much more damn&rsquo;d Design? Who wou&rsquo;d expect
Reason from one that raves, or hope for Mercy in a Tyger&rsquo;s Den? Believe me,
<i>Friendly</i>, all this may sooner be; Mercy may sooner dwell among the <ins class='corr' title="Transcriber&rsquo;s Note: The original showed &lsquo;Salvage&rsquo;.">Savage</ins> Wolves
and Bears, than in a Woman&rsquo;s Breast.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O, my too rigid Fate, to place me thus on such a dangerous Precipice, that
wheresoe&rsquo;re I turn my self for help, I see my Ruin still before mine Eyes.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[Seems to weep.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> [<i>Pausing.</i>] Stay&mdash;The Command which thy <i>Medea</i> sent thee,
was to kill thy only dearest Friend, was it not?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Alas! it was.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Then here, all Friendship dies between us; thus hast thou kill&rsquo;d thy Friend,
and satisfied that infernal Hag, thy cursed Mistress, who thus commanded thee:
Away, I say, begon, and never see me more.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<i>Bon.</i> Yes, base ungrateful Wretch, farewel, (<i>Offers to go</i>) &mdash;Yet stay, and
since that Sacred Tie of Friendship&rsquo;s broke, know thou, most vile of Men, that <i>Bonvile</i>&rsquo;s
now thy Enemy; therefore do thou draw and guard thy spotted Life.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> How, Friend!</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Friend didst thou call me? On forfeit of thy Life that word no more; the
very Name of Friend from thee, shall be a Quarrel: How can I tell but that thou
lovest my Wife, and therefore feign&rsquo;d this damn&rsquo;d Design to draw me from her Arms?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> How! wrong thy Wife? O no, I never had a Thought so vile! Yet you must
forgive me, indeed you must, by all that once was dear to me; and what I dare not mention
more, by Love and Honour, I implore thy Pardon&mdash;Still art thou deaf to my
Complaints?&mdash;Nay, then upon my Knee, I will enforce thy Pity. Behold me, <i>Bonvile</i>,
prostrate at thy Feet, crawling for Mercy, swimming in Tears, and almost
drown&rsquo;d with Shame; extend thy Arm to help me, as thou&rsquo;rt a Man, be God-like in
thy Nature, and raise me from the Grave; turn thy Eyes on me, and sink me not with
Frowns; O save me, save me, or I fall for ever.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> As soon shall Heav&rsquo;n reverse the Fate of Hell, as I recal what I have said, or
plant thee in my Breast again.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Nay, then I am lost to thee, and all the World besides.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[Rises.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Thou are indeed for ever lost to me; see what a miserable Wretch thy Folly
now has made thee: A Creature so far below my Pity, that I despise and scorn thy
base Submission, and will never hear thee more, more.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Say but thou hast forgiven me, and I will ask no more.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I never will.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O cruel <i>Bonvile</i>!</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> More barbarous <i>Friendly</i>: Hold off, or I will use thee like a Dog, tread thee
to Earth, and spurn thee like a Slave, base as thou art.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Still thou art my Friend&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Thou ly&rsquo;st, I have abjured the Name.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Let me but go with thee.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> Not for the World; I&rsquo;de rather venture my self with Crocodiles, catch the
last dying Gasps of some poor Wretch infested with the Plague, than trust my self
with thee.</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Nurse, Compass,</span> and his Wife.</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> Indeed you must pardon me, I can&rsquo;t let ye see the Child; to tell you the
Truth, I am commanded to the contrary.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Commanded! Prethee who commanded thee?</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> The Father.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> The Father, Why who am I?</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> Not the Father sure, the Civil Law has found it otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> The Civil Law found it otherwise! Why then the Uncivil Law shall make it
mine again, I&rsquo;ll be as dreadful as a <i>Shrove-Tuesday</i> to thee; for I&rsquo;ll besiege thy squalling
catterwauling Castle, with my Friends the Mob, and gut thy stinking Nursery,
but I&rsquo;ll both see and have my Child.</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> Harkee, Goodman Swabber, say but half so much again, and I&rsquo;ll call the
Constable, and lay Burglary to your Charge. You wou&rsquo;d not be so hot if the Enemy
were in View, nor if you had to do with any body but a poor innocent Woman,
so you wou&rsquo;d&rsquo;nt.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Good Husband be patient, and let me alone with her: Come, come, good
Nurse, let him see the Boy.</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> Indeed I dare not Goody <i>Compass</i>: The Father first you know delivered me
the Child, and order&rsquo;d me to let no body see it. He pays me well and weekly for
my Pains, and therefore I&rsquo;ll do as be bad me, so I will.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Why thou white Bastard-breeder; Is not this Woman here the Mother?</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> Yes, I grant you that.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Do you so? Well, and I grant it too; And is not the Child then my own by
the Wives Copy-hold?</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> The Law must try that.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> The Law! What then you think I&rsquo;ll be but its Father-in-Law? I tell thee,
all the Wit and Law twixt <i>Cuckolds-Point</i> and <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, shan&rsquo;t keep my own
dear Flesh and Blood from me, I warrant you that. No an&rsquo;t does, I&rsquo;ll be hanged at
the Main-yard: Why, who, dost think, uses to get my Children but my self?</p>

<p><i>Nurse.</i> Nay, I can&rsquo;t tell; you must look to that, for my part I ne&rsquo;re knew you get
any.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Say&rsquo;st thou so? Why, look you, do but put on a clean Smock, and try me,
if thou darst, I&rsquo;ll hold thee three to one I get thee with Child before I leave thee:
Heh! what say&rsquo;st thou?<br />

<p><i>Comp.</i> Both! Good morrow to you and your Wife too, if you go to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> I wou&rsquo;d speak calmly with you, Friend, if you think fit.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> I know what belongs to Calm, and a Storm too; and if you please, a cold
word or two wi&rsquo; you.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> With all my Heart.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> I understand that you have ty&rsquo;d your Mare in my Ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> My Mare, Friend, nay I assure you, &rsquo;twas only my Nag.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Your Nag? Well your Nag then let it be: Harke, Sir, to be short, I&rsquo;ll cut
off your Nag&rsquo;s Tail, if e&rsquo;re I catch him there again.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> Pray hear me, you are too rough to maintain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> I say, Sir, you shall maintain no Child of mine; my Wife does not bestow
her Labour for that purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> You are too passionate&mdash;I will not maintain&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> No marry shall you not.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> The Deed I have done to be lawful, I have repented it, and given Satisfaction
to the Law, my Purse has paid for&rsquo;t; therefore I wou&rsquo;d treat milder with you
if you&rsquo;d be pleased.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Yes, yes, I am very well pleased, and shall be better pleased if you can serve
me so still: For, look you Sir, one of these Days I shall to Sea again, you know where
my Wife lives; yet you&rsquo;l but lose your labour, for get as many Children as you can, I
assure you, you shall keep none of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> I think you are mad.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Why, if I am Horn-mad, what&rsquo;s that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> Nay then, since you are so rough, I tell you plainly you are&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> A what? What am I, heh?</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> A Coxcomb.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> A Coxcomb! a Cuckold you mean, and you a Fool for your pains.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> The Child is mine, I am the Father of it, and will keep it.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Yes if you can, I know you will. But pray tell me, is not my Wife the
Mother? You may be as far from being the Father as I am, for my Wife&rsquo;s acquainted
with more Whore-masters besides your self; ay, and as crafty Merchants too, let
me tell you that.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> No indeed Husband, I had to do with no body else, &rsquo;twas he begot, indeed
and indeed now. Yet for all that, the Child&rsquo;s mine, I bred it and bore it, and I&rsquo;ll
have it and keep it, so I will.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Ven.</i> Pray hold there Mrs. Jill-flurt, the Child&rsquo;s my Husband&rsquo;s, and he shall
have it, or I&rsquo;ll tear your Eyes out, ye Whore you.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Good Words, Mistress; d&rsquo;ye hear, give good Words you&rsquo;d best, or I shall
tell you your own.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> I&rsquo;ll have no more to say to ye, the Law shall determine it; in the mean

<p><i>Nurse.</i> I have two Hands, you see Gentlemen; this does but show ye how the Law
will hamper ye; even thus you&rsquo;l be used, Gentlemen, if you go to Law.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> It can&rsquo;t be helpt, for I won&rsquo;t lose my Right.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Daughter, Daughter! Where&rsquo;s my Daughter? I say, Where&rsquo;s my Daughter?
O Girl, I have the best News to tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> What of my Husband, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> No, no, of your Cousin, Girl, of your Cousin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><i>Ara.</i> What of him, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Such a Cousin, Girl, such a dear Cousin he is, as <i>Alexander the Great</i>, if he
were alive, might be proud and boast of.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> You&rsquo;re welcome here again, Sir; You&rsquo;ve made but a short Voyage, pray
what occasion&rsquo;d your Return so speedily?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Madam, I render you ten thousand Thanks; Your Generosity and Goodness
has wholly made me yours; I am the humblest of your faithful Admirers.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Forbear such lavish Gratitude; You&rsquo;r too profuse in your Acknowledgment
of your small Favours. But pray be brief, and let me know the happy Occasion of
this your sudden Return, I long methinks to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Madam, you may command me&mdash;Not to molest the Company with the
Recital of every vain and needless Circumstance; &rsquo;twas briefly thus. Scarce had we
passed by <i>Marget</i> on our Course, when on a sudden, from the Top-mast head, a Sailer
cries, All hands Aloft, three Sails ahead: With that we rumidg and clear our
Deck, our Gun-room arm&rsquo;d, and all things now are ready for a Fight. The Ships
before descried, with warlike Stems cut the resisting Waves, whilst from their Pendants
fluttering in the Air, we found they were three <i>Dunkirk</i> Privateers; they
having made our English Cross advanced, salute us with a Broad-side, to make us
strike and yield: But we, who ne&rsquo;re knew as yet what &rsquo;twas so cowardly to yield,
and not regarding their unequal Odds, fell boldly on, returning Fire for Fire. The
Engagement then grew desperate, for they on either Side fired in amain, whilst we
withstood their Force. At length they boldly grappled, and laid us close aboard,
and we as bravely beat them off again.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> But now, Daughter, mark what follows, for that&rsquo;s worth all, I&rsquo;faith it is;
therefore go on, dear Cuz, go on.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Sea-room at length we got; when (as Fate wou&rsquo;d have it) an unlucky
Shot struck both the Captain and Lieutenant dead. Then we began to fear, and all
our noble Hearts were trembling with despair.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> No, no, not all Daughter&mdash;But you shall hear more&mdash;Ods bobs you
shall.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> How cou&rsquo;d it be otherwise, when both our Commanders now were lost?
therefore to strike was all the Talk&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Ay, ay, now Daughter, now comes the Play, the other was only the Prologue.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> But Fortune favouring, and the Wind springing a fresh Gale, we got clear
off and try&rsquo;d to make a running Fight.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Ay, but Cuz, how did we do all this? by whose Order and Direction?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Pardon me, Sir, &rsquo;twas of so small Moment, that already it has slipt my treacherous
Memory.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Oh, ho! has it so! Ha, ha, ha! But it has not mine, I thank you, no marry
has it not, as you shall hear&mdash;Then he, with an undaunted Spirit, started up
amongst the Sailers, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Nay pray Sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> By the Foot of <i>Pharaoh</i> I&rsquo;ll not be balkt; he, I say, with an Heroick Voice
cried out, Courage brave boys, Charge and Discharge amain; come I&rsquo;ll supply your
fall&rsquo;n Captain&rsquo;s place. At this blest News they all fell on again, with ten thousand
times more Fury than before: Victory, Victory, was all their cry, whilst he my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Cousin here, whom I shall ne&rsquo;re forget, for by the Lord, methinks, I see him in the
Fight this very Instant, now running this way, now running that way, now down to
the Gun-room to encourage those that fought there; now upon the Deck again,
still crying out, Fear not, brave Boys, the Day will soon be our&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> O pray, Sir, let me intreat you to forbear, you make me ashamed, I protest,
to hear you.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Ashamed, say you? Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Good Sir, go on.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> I will, I will&mdash;At length the proud French swallowing too many of our English
Balls, two of &rsquo;em very fairly cried, Your Servants Gentlemen, farewel, and down
they went. The other having lost most of her Men, resolved to leave us; but we
being too nimble, overtook her, clapt some Men aboard, and brought her in a Prize:
And this my brave Man of War here, was the first that boarded her with Sword in
Hand.</p>

<p><i>1 Sailer.</i> Of all this I was an Eye-witness.</p>

<p><i>2 Sailer.</i> And so was I.</p>

<p><i>3 Sailer.</i> And I, and all of us.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Yes, and many more stout Boys besides.</p>

<p><i>Spruce.</i> Sir, we are all indebted to your Valour; such Voyages as these, from
small Venturers, in time may make us great Merchants.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Well, never was Fight better managed before, that&rsquo;s certain.</p>

<p><i>1 Sail.</i> No, never, never!</p>

<p><i>2 Sail.</i> Better, say you? No nor half so well.</p>

<p><i>3 Sail.</i> If it were in our Power, we&rsquo;d make him Admiral, so we wou&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Gentlemen, &rsquo;tis to your Valours all, that I am indebted for the Honour I
have gain&rsquo;d: And that I may not seem wholly ungrateful, there, there&rsquo;s something
in token of my Thankfulness.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Gives &rsquo;em Money.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>1, 2, 3 Sailers.</i> Heaven bless your Worship.</p>

will be pleased to drink what our House affords, they shall be welcome.</p>

<p><i>2 Sail.</i> Well, this Mr. <i>Summerfield</i> is a brave Fellow, Gadzooks he is.</p>

Conscience.</p>

<p><i>1 Sail.</i> On my Soul and so we had: O if you had but seen him when he boarded
the <i>Monsieur</i>, &rsquo;twou&rsquo;d have made you laugh &rsquo;till you had split your Sides. He came
up to the Captain o&rsquo;this fashion with a Slap&mdash;ha! and gave him such a back-handed
wipe, that he cut off his Head as genteely, as tho he had served seven Years Apprenticeship
to&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> And what do you think of my Cause, Mr. <i>Dodge</i>?</p>

<p><i>Dodge.</i> O we shall carry it most certainly: You have Money to go through with the
Business; and ne&rsquo;re fear but we&rsquo;ll trounce them swingingly.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> I warrant you think it very strange, Mr. <i>Dodge</i>, that I am at this Charge
and Expence to bring a farther Charge upon me.</p>

<p><i>Dodge.</i> Not I, I assure you, Sir, for I know you are a wise Man, and know very
well what you do; besides you have Money, Money enough, Sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> Why the short and the long of the Business is this; I made a Purchase
lately, and in that I did estate the Child (about which I&rsquo;m sued) Joint-Purchaser
with me in all the Land I bought.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Ven.</i> Right Husband; and you know &rsquo;twas I that advised you to make the
Purchase, and therefore I&rsquo;ll never give my Consent to have the Child brought up by
such a stinking Tar-barrel as now sues for him; he&rsquo;d only bring him up to be a Swabber;
no, no, he was born a Merchant and a Gentleman, and he shall live and die so.</p>

<p><i>Dodge.</i> You are a worthy Gentlewoman upon my word; there are but few of such a
noble Temper: But what makes the Fool of the Husband then so troublesome; does
he not know when he&rsquo;s well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Ven.</i> So &rsquo;tis a sign.</p>

<p><i>Dodge.</i> A Blockhead, to proclaim his own Disgrace, and make himself laugh&rsquo;d at.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ven.</i> That&rsquo;s not it, he hopes to be the better by what is settled on the Boy.</p>

<p><i>Dodge.</i> O, God&rsquo;s so, that&rsquo;s true: But never fear, I&rsquo;ll be hang&rsquo;d if he carry it, for
you have Money, as I told you, Sir, before: but see, Sir, there they are.</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> Why look you Sir, the Defendant you know was arrested first by a <i>Latitat</i>
in an Action of Trespass.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Yes, and a Lawyer told me, it shou&rsquo;d have been an Action of the Case, did
he not, Wife?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> I have no Skill in the Law you know Husband, but the Gentleman did say so.</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> Aye, but your Action of the Case in this Point is too ticklish.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Well, but pray tell me, do you think I shall overthrow my Adversary?</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> Without all doubt, the Child he says is none of yours, What of that! I marry
a Widow, and am by Consequence possess&rsquo;d of a Ward. Now shall not I have the
Management of that Ward? Now Sir you lie at a stronger Ward, for <i>Partus sequitur

as the Common Law goes, the Child must be yours, that&rsquo;s certain.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> With all my Heart, kind Sir, fare you well.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Farewel Widow, remember Time and Place, and d&rsquo; you hear, Put on your
Sabbath-day best Clothes.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Sir, I am beholding to you for your good Counsel.</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> No, Sir, you have paid me for &rsquo;t, but I hope you do not intend to follow
your own.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> What is that?</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> Why, you said you&rsquo;d hang your self.</p>

<p><i>Camp.</i> No no, I have thought better on&rsquo;t, for I&rsquo;ll go drink my self dead drunk, then
wake again, wash my Face, and meet the Bride.</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> That&rsquo;s well said, and I&rsquo;ll accompany you, and wish you Joy.</p>

<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Friendly solus</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Was ever Fortune like to this of mine? Who for the Smile of a vile simple Woman,
have acted thus against my very Soul, all to please a Creature, whose next Command
perhaps will higher mount, it may be light on my self, as now it did on <i>Bonvile</i>.</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Clara</span>.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Ha! <i>Friendly</i> here alone. Now, now, my Fears begin.<span class='i ralign'>[Aside.</span><br />
So, Sir, you are return&rsquo;d I see.<span class='i ralign'>[To him.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Madam, I am, and like those noble Knights in former times, after subduing
all their Ladies Foes, returning with the joyful News of Conquest, receive her trembling
to their longing Arms, and claim her as their own, so I&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> What mean you, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Madam, You are obeyed, your hard Commands fulfilled; at your Request
I&rsquo;ve kill&rsquo;d my Friend, nay and my best of Friends.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> How? kill&rsquo;d your Friend for me.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Indeed &rsquo;tis true.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Then thou art truly wretched: But say, say quickly, who&rsquo;s this unhappy
Man whom thy Mistake hath thus untimely kill&rsquo;d?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> <i>Bonvile.</i></p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> <i>Bonvile</i> said you? My Blood with an unusual Course runs backward from my
Heart! Horror has seiz&rsquo;d my Soul! A thick-black Mist has overcast my Sight, and I
am not the same: but speak, O speak again, Was it <i>Bonvile</i>?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Why shou&rsquo;d you seek to iterate my Guilt, by a Rehearsal of that dreadful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Name? Too sure, alas! It was: <i>Bonvile</i>&rsquo;s the Friend I&rsquo;ve kill&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Curs&rsquo;d be the Tongue that spoke it, but doubly curs&rsquo;d the Hand that did the
barbarous Fact.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Why Madam, was it not your Command to kill my Friend; nay more, my
best of Friends?</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Yes, and I thought my self your best of Friends.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> I hope you wou&rsquo;d not have had me murder&rsquo;d you?</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> No, Monster, no.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> These are Riddles.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Fool, our whole Sex is made of nothing else: Thou mayst sooner untie the
Gordian Knot, expound the Problems of the monstrous <i>Sphynx</i>, and read what is
decreed in the mysterious Book of Fate, than unfold a Woman&rsquo;s sly malitious Meaning.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Very well; she first set me on to do this most accurs&rsquo;d of Deeds, and now upbraids
me; nay wou&rsquo;d hang me for &rsquo;t: These are the Tricks of all her damning Sex.
O Woman, Woman, Woman, dear devilish Woman, farewel.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Offers to go.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Stay <i>Friendly</i>, all I have said was only to try your Constancy; and whether
you&rsquo;d repent of what you&rsquo;ve done. But tell me truly, is <i>Bonvile</i> surely dead?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Indeed he is.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> &rsquo;Tis bravely done, and I adore thee for &rsquo;t. By Heaven I love thee now, even
unto Dotage!</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Was ever Change like this? The subtlest Labyrinth Wit cou&rsquo;d ere invent,
affords not half so many Turnings as a Woman&rsquo;s Mind.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Aside.</span><br /></p>

<p>What mean you, Madam, by this seeming Transport?</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> O <i>Friendly</i>, <i>Friendly</i>, I am all o&rsquo;re Extasy! Thou hast done a Deed that ravishes
my Soul. At once thou hast kill&rsquo;d my dear and only Friend, and slain the fatal&rsquo;st
Enemy I had.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> What more Riddles Madam, pray explain your self.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> I will; I will declare a Secret which till now I never did disclose: I lov&rsquo;d that
<i>Bonvile</i> whom thou now hast slain, not as I ought to do, but with a Woman&rsquo;s Love,
which he never did know: And Yesterday when I beheld the fatal Marriage ended,
then like a Merchant walking on the <i>Downes</i>, sees a rich Vessel of his own engaged, and
after took, and born away a Prize: So I, after I&rsquo;d seen my <i>Bonvile</i> lost, (for so he
was to me) resuming all the Malice of a Woman, resolved never to entertain one
Thought of Love again; but lead a Life as <i>Lapland</i> Witches do, only on others Ruines:
Then when you approached me with the hateful Sound of Love, to dash your Hopes,
and put a Period to your growing Passion, I bid you kill your best and dearest Friend?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> True.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Now the best Friend to one in Love, is Love it self.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O my curs&rsquo;d Stars, that wrap&rsquo;d me up in such a black Mistake, What have I
done?</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> Done! Why you have done bravely, why do you tremble?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> An inward Guilt lies heavy on my Soul, and Horror with all her dreadful
Forms still haunts my Sight. And did you love this <i>Bonvile</i>?</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> The Queen of Beauty never doted more on her beloved <i>Adonis</i> than I on
him.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> And now as much you hate him: O the unheard-of Inconstancy of Women!
All that they have is feign&rsquo;d; their Teeth, their Hair, their Blushes, and their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Smiles; nay their very Conscience (if any such they have) is feign&rsquo;d; all counterfeit
and false: Let them wash, patch and daub themselves with all the Helps for Nature
that Art cou&rsquo;d e&rsquo;re invent, still they are Women: And let &rsquo;em rob all <i>India</i> of its store
to adorn themselves therewith, still are they not all that thing call&rsquo;d Woman: I know
not what to do, for I love and hate this Creature both at once.</p>

<p><i>Cla.</i> What ails my <i>Friendly</i>?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> But <i>Bonvile</i> yet must feel his Enemies Rage; shall he succeed in Love, whilst I
am cross&rsquo;d in mine? No, it must not, cannot, nay it shall not be.</p>

shall ye now be Evidences to our next Meeting, which I look for every Minute.</p>

<p>1st <i>Neigh.</i> I came for that Intent, Neighbour.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> I thank you: well, I do not think but you&rsquo;ll all see me come off with as smooth
a Forehead, and make my Wife as honest a Woman as a Man wou&rsquo;d desire sometimes,
I mean of her Rank; and a teeming Woman, as you know she has been: Nay, I do
not think but the Child too will be found to be as lawful a Child as any Couple of unmarried
People can beget.</p>

<p>2d <i>Neigh.</i> We long to see it Neighbour <i>Compasse</i>, that so some of us may do the
like upon the same occasion.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> You&rsquo;re in the right, old Stitch of the World: But soft, see where she comes
with a whole Bundle of as good sound Maidens as her self.</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Peg</span> new cloth&rsquo;d, with three or four Women Neighbours.</p>

<p>Stand aside a little, and mind me I pray.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Agreed, agreed.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Good Morrow fair Maid.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> In truth Sir you are mistaken in both, for I am neither fair, nor yet a Maid.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> No, what are you then I pray, a Wife?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> That indeed I was, but alas,&mdash;I am now a Widow.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> A Widow say you? Nay then I must make bold with you; for look you,
your Case is somewhat like mine, I being a Husband without a Wife.</p>

<p>1st <i>Neigh.</i> Aye neighbour, this is something like.</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> They begin well, let them go on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<i>Comp.</i> How long have you been a Widow, good Woman? Nay pray do not weep
forsooth.</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> I can&rsquo;t choose but cry, to think of the great Loss I had.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Why, was he an honest Man?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Honest quoth a&rsquo;, I vow and protest he was as honest a Man as e&rsquo;re broke Bread.
O I shall never have such another.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Cries out.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> By my Faith now Mistress you have had a great Loss indeed, for an honest
Man is not to be found every where, nor in every Street.</p>

<p><i>Pett.</i> The Rogue&rsquo;s witty.</p>

<p>2d <i>Neigh.</i> Aye, aye, let &rsquo;em go on.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> And how long is it since you lost this honest Husband?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> O dear, his Memory is too fresh; and the Sight of you doubles my Sorrow.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> The Sight of me, say you; why, was he so like me?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> As one Apple to another; your two Hands are not more alike.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Nay then I cannot blame thee to weep: An honest Man he was I warrant
him; and you have had a mighty Loss, that&rsquo;s the Truth on&rsquo;t: But was he proportioned
like me, so well limb&rsquo;d, and of such a wholesom Complexion, heh!</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> No Twins were ever more alike.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Well I love, his Memory is still better and better: and how many Children
did he leave behind him?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Only one, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> A Boy or a Girl?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> A dainty fine Boy, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Just my own case still; my Wife (rest her Soul) left me a Boy too, a lusty
chopping Boy of his Age (as they tell me, for I never saw it).</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> So is mine.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> And what Profession was your Husband of?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> A Seaman.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Heigh! my own Faculty too! And can you like a Man of that Profession
again?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Yes surely, for his dear sake, whom I lov&rsquo;d so tenderly, I shall always esteem
a Sailer.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Shall you so? why then here&rsquo;s your Man: What say you, Is&rsquo;t a Match?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Dear me, I am so ashamed, and yet to speak the Truth, I do like you hugely,
and wou&rsquo;d like you better still, if it were not for one thing, which a little troubles me.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> What&rsquo;s that?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Why, you know sometimes we are forc&rsquo;d to endure the Absence of our Husbands
a long while, mehappen many Years, and then if there be any Slip in us, (as long
Vacations will make Lawyers hungry) the World is apt to censure and scandalize us;
and brand us with wanton Living and Incontinency; when alas! if they wou&rsquo;d but
consider our Condition, and the mighty Longings we often naturally have for Flesh
and Blood, they wou&rsquo;d not blame us, so they wou&rsquo;d not.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Come, come, no Matter, canst thou love me, Widow?</p>

<p><i>Peg.</i> Ah, if I durst but speak my Mind, I know what I wou&rsquo;d say.</p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> Durst, why who do you fear? here&rsquo;s none but an honest Gentleman, some
few Friends and Neighbours; let them hear a God&rsquo;s Name what you wou&rsquo;d say, and
never blush for the Matter.</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Mr. <i>Summerfield</i>, I now am truly happy, my Prayers at last are heard; and
Heaven has restored my Husband to my Arms.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> I just now heard the joyful News, and thought to have been my self the welcome
Messenger of his Return, but find I&rsquo;me come too late; have you seen him?</p>

<p><i>Art.</i> No; as yet I have not.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> &rsquo;Tis somewhat strange!</p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Others perhaps may judg it so, but my uncommon Joy for his Return, admits
no other Thought, but those of Transport for his Safety.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> O happy <i>Bonvile</i>! How I admire and wonder at thy Choice!</p>

<p class='sd'>Enter <span class='n'>Friendly</span>.</p>

<p>Madam, a Wife like you, exceeds the greatest Blessing sure on Earth.</p>

<p><i>Fr.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] The nearest way to a secure Revenge, is private Malice, which, like
a Spark long lying hid amongst neglected Ashes, by the least Blast of Wind
becomes it self a Flame&mdash;Ha!, who have we here? Thrice blest Occasion!
which thus have offered me at once the Scope of my revengeful Wishes. &rsquo;Tis
<i>Arabella</i> and her Darling <i>Summerfield</i>, one who, in the Bridegroom&rsquo;s Absence,
is grown thus intimate with his beloved Bride. A strong Foundation on
which I&rsquo;ll now erect a brave Revenge; I&rsquo;ll step aside and observe them.<br />
<span class='i ralign'>[Retires to one side of the Stage.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Ara.</i> Sir, I hope he&rsquo;ll soon be here, and return the Kindness you have shown me;
so I take my leave, with hourly expectation of a much-long&rsquo;d for Husband.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> And I, with a Gratitude never to be forgotten, kiss your fair Hand, and
hope that all things will answer your Expectation.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Exit <span class='n'>Arabella</span>.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Ay, &rsquo;tis so, now must I counterfeit a friendly Face to make a farther Discovery. [<i>Aside.</i>]<br />
Sir, your humble Servant: without Offence, may I be so bold as to beg the Favour of
your Name?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> The Question I must confess is somewhat familiar, and in my Opinion improper
for a Stranger at first sight; but yet I ne&rsquo;re disown&rsquo;d it to a Gentleman&mdash;&rsquo;tis
<i>Summerfield</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fri. Summerfield!</i> Sir, I kiss your Hand;, and must congratulate your good Success,
but more admire your Valour. Had we many such noble Commanders on board
our Fleet, we need not fear it where e&rsquo;re it sails.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>Sum.</i> Pray, Sir, stretch not your Love into Flattery, &rsquo;twill make me then suspect
your Kindness. And the Author of this Story was too much my Friend I see, since
he has given you this so very partial Account, the more to augment my Fame.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O! that&rsquo;s your Modesty, Sir: But if I might be so happy as to be honour&rsquo;d
with your Acquaintance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Sir, the Honour (if any) would be wholly on my Side; therefore I desire
to know your Name.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> <i>Friendly</i>, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> An Acquaintance; I suppose, of Mr. <i>Bonvile&rsquo;s</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> One that thinks himself much honour&rsquo;d in being stiled his Friend.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> I have often heard your Name indeed before; but till now Fortune never afforded
me the sight of you.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> You of all Men ought to bless Fortune, who still has been indulgent to you
on all Occasions; and scatter&rsquo;d her Favours on you, with as prodigal a Hand as th&ocirc;
you were her sole Care and only Minion.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> What mean you, Sir? Again you exceed the Bounds of Love and Friendship;
I never thought any of <i>Bonvil&rsquo;s</i> Friends cou&rsquo;d be guilty of so base and vile a
thing as Flattery: But, pray, unfold your meaning.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> &rsquo;Tis this; I just now saw you part with the Bride, with such  courteous Actions,
as spoke no small Esteem in her kind Favour; and therein I think you the happiest of
Men.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Mistake me not, I only as a Friend applaud your Happiness, bless the
Influence of your kinder Stars, and praise your Fortune that hath given you this sweet
Occasion.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> What Occasion, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Of being serviceable to the fair Virgin Bride in her extreamest need, after her
being so unkindly left, nay, on her Wedding Day, by an ungrateful Husband, in doing
her those neglected Duties, her Youth and Beauty justly did demand.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> On my Life some Plot against the Bride: I&rsquo;ll sound him &rsquo;till I find the very
Bottom&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Sir, you are merry: But suppose the Case your own,
wou&rsquo;d you have miss&rsquo;d so tempting an Occasion?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> No, Sir, they&rsquo;re too precious to be omitted: But I hear you two call Cousins,
comes your Kindred by the <i>Merryman&rsquo;s</i> or the <i>Bonvile&rsquo;s</i>?</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Neither! we were wholly Strangers &rsquo;till of late, and &rsquo;tis a word of Courtesy
only interchange&rsquo;d between us for some private Reasons.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> This goes as I cou&rsquo;d wish. <span class='i ralign'>[Aside.]</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> I desire you not to grow too inward with me, on so short an Acquaintance:
Not that I&rsquo;de have you think the Lady of so base a Disposition to grant me any thing
beyond the Rules of Decency and Honour. The only Favour I e&rsquo;re receiv&rsquo;d from her,
was a Present of those Bracelets she wears about her Arms, and that Chain of Gold
and Pearl she has about her Neck; all which either of us may own without a Blush.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> How, the Chain and Bracelet, say you! Those were the first Tokens of her
Husband&rsquo;s Love.</p>

<p><i>Sum.</i> Methinks you look concern&rsquo;d at what I&rsquo;ve said; yet I have said no more than
what I am obliged in Honour to maintain, and will: therefore I hope, as you&rsquo;r a Gentleman,
you&rsquo;l not turn Informer.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> O Master <i>Friendly</i>, you&rsquo;re happily returned: But where&rsquo;s my Son-in-Law?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Alas, Sir, the unhappy <i>Bonvile</i> is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Is, is, what is he? Heh! speak; is he living, or is he dead; or what&rsquo;s become
of him?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O! that I had the Marble <i>Niobes</i> Heart! Or that I had suck&rsquo;d the Milk of
Wolves and Tigers; so that I might have told, without the least remorse of Sorrow,
what now I dare not, nay, I cannot speak, for fear at once I melt my self in Tears,
and break your aged Heart.<br /><span class='i ralign'>[Seems to weep.</span><br /></p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Then I suppose he&rsquo;s killed; say, is he not? Hast thou inticed him from his
Bride for this, thou inhumane Wretch? Yet speak, and tell me truly, for I&rsquo;m prepared
to hear the worst of Ills; Is he then slain?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> No, Sir, but dangerously wounded.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Not mortally, I hope; but whereabouts is he so desperately wounded? In his
Arms, his Legs, or Body?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Neither, Sir, but in as perfect Health as when he left you.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Strange! sure thou art all o&rsquo;re a Mystery, and form&rsquo;st these Riddles to try
my Wit.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> No, Sir, for all I have said, you in effect will surely find I told you he was
wounded, did I not?</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Yes, you did.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> And so he is.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> But where, whereabout, I ask you once again?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> I see you force the unwilling Secret from me&mdash;Why, he&rsquo;s wounded.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> He&rsquo;s wounded, he&rsquo;s wounded, but where, where is he wounded?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> In his Fame, Honour and Reputation, more mortal than a thousand fleshy
Wounds.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Her Father, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Audacious Villain, O that I had thee in some private Corner, where none
you&rsquo;d either see or hear us, this Sword shou&rsquo;d justify my Daughter&rsquo;s Honour; I&rsquo;de
Whore you with a Pox to you, so I wou&rsquo;d.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> Your Pardon, Sir, I only did inform you as a Friend, that by your fatherly
Admonitions, you might refrain her from her undecent Course.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Pox o&rsquo; your friendly Intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> The Jewels which her Husband did present her, as the first Sign and Confirmation

quick.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Ha, ha, ha, the Fool makes me laugh; Ha, ha, ha, why &rsquo;twas but just now
that I saw e&rsquo;m on her Neck and Arms.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> She was no Woman, had she not the Sense to get them against her Husband&rsquo;s
coming.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> But pray tell me, how is&rsquo;t possible that she cou&rsquo;d part with &rsquo;em, when they
are lock&rsquo;t on, and the Key with her Husband?</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> O, Sir, that&rsquo;s no Question to be ask&rsquo;d in these Times: Women <i>have found a
way to make use of other Keys besides their Husbands: And no doubt but</i> Summerfield <i>has
got a Key will open your Daughter&rsquo;s lock as well as</i>  Bonvile&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Sirrah you lie, you lie Sirrah; and I&rsquo;le tell thee thou ly&rsquo;s, again and again,
so I will. Nay, and I were to pay a 100 Pounds for every Lie I give thee, as Men do
Twelve-pence for every Oath they swear, I wou&rsquo;d spend all the Thousands I am
worth, in giving thee the Lie. &rsquo;Tis likely indeed, that such a brave Gentleman as
<i>Summerfield</i>, that fought at Sea like a Dragon to save my Life, should shorten my Days
on Land in ruining my Daughter; therefore once more I tell you you Lie.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i> &rsquo;Tis very well.</p>

<p><i>Bon.</i> I humbly thank you, Sir; but am sorry to see you so disturb&rsquo;d.</p>

at the Coxcomb, Ha, ha, ha; He told me, Ha, ha, ha, that one <i>Summerfield</i>, a

<p><i>Bon.</i> Ha! my Wife.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Aye, aye, Love-Tokens I call&rsquo;d &rsquo;em when I was a young Man: Nay, the

<p><i>Mer.</i> Ay, ay, and so she might well; for she was a little cunning Thief too, to
steal the Gold she gave you from her Husband; &rsquo;twas all his now, but that&rsquo;s no matter, proceed.</p>

<p><i>Mer.</i> Ay, so I do, ods bobs I do, thy Valour my brave Boy, thy Valour, for
which I&rsquo;ll do for thee, that thou shalt never need to rob again I warrant thee; ods
